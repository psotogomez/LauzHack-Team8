User: Is this a tram station? 

AI: No, this is not strictly a tram station; it appears to be a train station, as indicated by the sign "RENENS CFF" which is associated with CFF (Swiss Federal Railways). The setting suggests a multi-modal transportation hub, which commonly serves both trains and trams, but the specific signage and infrastructure lean more towards a train station environment.
